#### Thoughts/Inspiration
I like to paint with many colors. I’ve even painted my room five different colors. I work much in the same way. I’d like to invite potential employers, friends, and colleagues to have a pinhole glimpse of my life, code, and other ventures. </br>
I would like the site to look visually similar to my site from week 1.</br>
I’d like to have a template for a short story blog to encourage me to write more in the future. Maybe it could post snippets of stories to Twitter. Just had that thought, not sure what would be involved at this point. Stretch goal.</br>
A stretch goal would be to have video of the plays I’ve written, directed, and acted in available to stream.
Additional stretch goal, links to inspiring friends who are killing it in the world. And past employers I’m happy to endorse. </br>
A super stretch goal would be an API that only brings in women’s shoes in size 11, 11.5, and 12. I unfortunately have not found a helpful API for this goal, so it probably will not happen. Alas, one can dream.
