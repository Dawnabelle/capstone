Notes for 7/20/18

* Spent some time this week playing around with Gatsby blog starters. I found them quite confusing
* Volunteer shift at ACT-W 10am - 2pm, making up time for capstone project over the weekend

* Made many connections at ACT-W and ran my butt off as a volunteer. Watched Perry speak and supported advancing tech careers!
